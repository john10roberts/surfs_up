surfs_up_analysis

 ## Overview of Project
Investors have asked that we gather more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, they are wanting to see temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream business is sustainable year-round

### Results
The following table shows us that for June the number of total temperature observations is 1700, with mean temperature of around 75 degrees and a standard deviation of around 3.26 degrees. Assuming a normal distribution of temperatures 99% of the data will fall between 64 - 84 degrees. June temperatures seem ideal for a surf/ice cream business.

The following table shows us that for December the number of total temperature observations is 1517, with mean temperature of around 71 degrees and a standard deviation of around 3.75 degrees. Assuming a normal distribution of temperatures 99% of the data will fall between 60 - 82 degrees. While the December temperature range is a little more volatile and temperatures do decline slightly. It still is the perfect range of temperatures for surf/ice cream business.

- Min temperature from both observations - 56 degrees
- Max temperature from both observations - 85 degrees
- Total Observations - 3217

### Summary
The temperature ranges are ideal for board short surfing as sixty-six is the minimum according to surflearner.com. In the colder times a wetsuit would provide adequate temperature control to allow for surfing to be comfortable and safe. Additionally, I would want to see the precipitation levels for June and December to show investors that rainfall should not be a deterrent to our surf shop.

Lastly, I would want to see the observations by each of the stations to make sure that the temperature readings were consistent in different areas of the island.

This data clearly shows that the temperature ranges are consistent at all the stations evaluated.
